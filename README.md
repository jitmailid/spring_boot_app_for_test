# Build an API, test it, and package it into a container
Build a simple HTTP web server API in any general-purpose programming language1 that interacts with the GitHub API and responds to requests on /<USER> with a list of the userâ€™s publicly available Gists2.
Create an automated test to validate that your web server API works. An example user to use as test data is octocat.
Package the web server API into a docker container that listens for requests on port 8080.
